# OFF-GRID-hacktion-figures
3d printable characters from the indie game OFF GRID. (www.offgridthegame.com)

These models are a work in progress and how only had a first pass print test, please feel free to improve upon them!

We advise that you look at how to 3D print to the specifications that you want; mainly height.

We have provided files with and without bases. Those models without bases are untested and very unlikely to be able to stand without a base.
